# Lasagna!

## Ingredients: 

2 Pounds Sausage Meat (Pork)  
1 Pound Ground Beef  
3 Medium Onions, Diced  
3 Garlic Cloves, Minced  
33 Ounces Crushed Tomatoes  
12 Ounces Tomato Paste  
2/3 Cups Water  
3 Tablespoons Sugar  
3 Tablespoons and 1/3 Cup of Parsley (Separate)  
2 Teaspoons Basil (Dried)  
3/4 Teaspons Fennel Seed (Optional)  
3/4 Teasponn Salt/1/4 Teaspoon Salt  
1/4 Teaspoon Pepper, Coarse  
1 Large Egg  
1 Carton Ricotta Cheese (But Cottage Cheese works well too!)  
4 cups Shredded Mozarella  
3/4 Cup Parmesan Cheese  

## Preparation

Prepare Noodles, Drain. (See Package or Instructions). If using home-made pasta, you'll want to boil them before using them, otherwise you can end up with raw pasta near the center.  

Cook Sausage, Beef, Onion over Medium Heat for 10 minutes or until the meat is cooked, breaking up into tiny pieces.  

Add Garlic, Cook 1 Minute. Optionally Drain (Worse for you if you leave it in, but the flavor is *fantastic*)  

In the same pan with the meat, add your Crushed Tomato, Tomato Paste, Sugar, 3 Tablespoons of Parsley, Basil, Fennel, (3/4)Salt, Pepper.   
Bring to boil then reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes, I did it for 4 hours. Longer is better until you're like, drying the sauce out.


Mix the Egg and Recotta/Cottage cheese in a bowl, with the remaining Parsley and Salt. 

I typically spray it with nonstick spray first. This is optional though.
Preheat oven to 375F. Spread meat sauce into baking dish. Put layer of Pasta on top. Layer of Cheese. Pasta. Meat. Pasta. Continue until desired depth is achieved. Put Mozarella and remaining Cheese Mix on top.

Make covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.

Let rest 15-20 minutes before serving, as it will be hot.

Enjoy
