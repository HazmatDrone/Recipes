# Pasta Noodles

## Notes!:
For this recipe, you *will* need a way to roll and cut your pasta! I have a Mixer with an attachment for this, but be warned - This is very hard to do by hand!  

## Ingredients  

1 Cup All Purpose Flour  
1/2 Teaspoon Salt  
1 Egg, Beaten  
2 Tablespoons Water (Optional, use if your dough is struggling to mix due to dryness)  

## Directions  

In your mixing bowl, put all the ingredients except the water in with a dough hook. Run the mixer slowly until the flour is somwhat incorporated, then at a medium speed until a dough ball forms.  

Extract your dough ball, flour your table or counter, as well as a rolling pin, and begin rolling the dough out, your goal being thin enough to go through your dough roller. For me, that's about 1cm thick.  


Cut it into strips with a knife, then feed it through your roller at smaller and smaller settings until it's at your desired thickness. Keep in mind it will swell during cooking.  
Dust flour on each strip as you finish it, to prevent them sticking to each other both before and after cutting.

Once your pasta is cut as desired (or not, if you're planning to make [Lasagna!](./Lasagna.md)) Boil it for approximately 4 minutes to cook. 


Enjoy your fresh pasta!
