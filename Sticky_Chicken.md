# Sticky Chicken

## This recipe is *bad* for you. Don't say I didn't warn you. That said, it's *so* good.

# Ingredients

### Chicken:  

3lb of Chicken Drumsticks (Around 2 packages where I am)  
2 eggs, beaten in a bowl  
Flour or Breadcrumbs in a bowl  
Optional: Garlic Salt in the Flour/Crumbs  

### Sauce:  

3 tbsp Soya Sauce (For flavor, I recommend going and buying the cheapest, saltiest stuff you can get. Trust me. NoName or GreatValue are decent picks.)  
3 tbsp Water  
1 Cup of White Sugar  
1/2 Cup of White Vinegar  
1/2 tsp Salt  
1 tbsp of Cornstarch  

## Preparation

Roll the Chicken in the egg until coated, then roll in the Flour. Repeat for extra fluffyness.  
Drop the Chicken into a deep frier or pot of oil (Please be careful!) and let it cook until the coating  
is firmly attached. You don't need to fully cook the chicken at this stage, though it will get close regardless.  

Place the chicken in a baking dish, and prepare the sauce.

For the sauce, put all of the ingredients listed under Sauce into a large bowl, and mix until well mixed. The cornstarch I find is typically the worst part, so I recommend using a stand mixer to automate it. Overmixing isn't an issue.  

Pour the sauce over the chicken, then put it in the oven for 45-60 minutes at 350.

Serve Chicken + Sauce over Rice, then brush your teeth after.
