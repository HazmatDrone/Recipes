# Baked French Fries

## Ingredients:  

 6 Regular Potatoes  
 1/4 Cup Veggie Oil  
 1 Tablespoon Sugar  
 1 Teaspoon Salt (To Taste)  
 1 Teaspoon Pepper (To Taste)  
 1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder (To Taste. I tend to go more.)
## Instructions

 1. Julienne (Normal French fry shape) your potatoes, put them in a collendar.  
 2. Sprinkle the sugar over the fries, making sure they're all well coated.  
 3. Leave the Collendar over somthing that can collect water, and allow it to rest for ~30 minutes  
 4. Mix the Salt, Pepper, Garlic, and Veggie Oil  
 5. Preheat the Oven to 425F.
 6. After the potatoes have rested, pat them dry with a paper towel, then thoroughly coat them in the oil mixture. You can put it all in a plastic bag, personally I used my Mixer's bowl and mixed it like stir fry.  
 7. Put the potatoes on a pan with non stick spray with aluminum foil, at most one layer deep.  
 8. Bake for 20 minutes, flip the potatoes, then bake for another 20 minutes.
 9. Ding, Fries are Done!
