#Curry Roux

##Ingredients:
Flour: 100g
Unsalter Butter: 100g
Curry Powder: 24g

##Directions:
Melt butter in pot on stove, once it is completely melted add the flour and stir with wooden spatula/spoon. Soon the two ingredients will combine and swell. Remove from heat and mix in curry powder. Add other spices to taste - cayenne powder is recommended.
Pour mixture into a parchment lined baking dish and allow to cool on countertop. Once cooled to room temperature, cover and refridgerate overnight. 
The following morning, remove parchment and cut solidified roux into cubed 1"x1" portions. These will keep in the fridge for over a month and can freeze for longer.
